  <h2 class="head-liner">Early Life</h2>
  <p>Growing up I played a lot of sports. I played basketball, ran cross country, and played soccer from a young age,
    and I was very competitive in everything I did. Living in Beijing, the air quality wasnâ€™t always fit for me to go
    outside so my parents decided to put me in swim lessons and on my school's swim team. Early on I started to excel at
    swimming. It was my escape into my own little world underwater. I also later began playing volley ball all
    throughout middle school, but while I enjoyed all the sports I played, I had to make the decision to pursue swimmer
    full-on with the hopes of going to swim in college. </p>
